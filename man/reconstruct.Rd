\title{Reconstruct Graph}
\usage{
reconstruct(df, max_depth = 1, max_k = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{edge list representation of the graph in the form u, v, w. Three columns 
are in this dataframe. Each of the columns represent a list of vertices u, list of vertices
v, and list of weights w. The edges are directed which means edge u -> v has weight w. 
To represent an undirected graph just input edges u, v, w and v, u, w.
The first column and second column represent the u and v vertices with 
character types. The third column represented the weight of the edges. Each row 
represents a weighted edge in the graph.}

\item{max_depth}{The maximum depth in the Breadth-First-Search of reconstruct. 
Default is 1, never input 0.}

\item{max_k}{For vertex whose degree is less than max_k, reconstruct will expand its neighbors 
until the degree reaches max_k. Default is 0.}
}
\value{
a reconstructed graph that can be inputted directly into the line function. 
This graph is represented in edge list form in an identical format as the input 
parameter df. Note it is also a directed edge list.
}
\description{
This function reconstructs your edge list graph into another condensed edge 
list graph which you can run the line algorithm on.
}
\details{
This is a function which takes a graph represented in edge list form as input. 
The edge list should be represented as a dataframe with the edges in the form of u, v, w. 
u, v are the vertice names and are turned into StringVectors in Rcpp. w is the 
edge weight and is transformed into a numeric vector in Rcpp.
This function then calls the original line algorithm written in C++. Too
gain a better understanding of what each parameter does please look at the 
the line paper in references and the implementation in the github link.
This function returns a reconstructed graph as a dataframe in the form u, v, w.
This reconstructed graph can be passed into line to run the main line algorithm for 
graph embedding.

\examples{
u <- c("good", "the", "bad")
v <- c("the", "good", "the")
w <- 1:3
df <- data.frame(u, v, w)
reconstruct(df)
reconstruct(df, max_depth = 2)
reconstruct(df, max_depth = 2, max_k = 2)
