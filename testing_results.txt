Extra Notes:
-for input files/dataframes, they must be in the form u, v, w. Although Rline can deal with just u, v or unweighted graphs, this updated Rline must be in the form u, v, w so it must be changed to add a w with all weights equal to one
-changed test5 to be with weighted inputs of all size 1. Moved test5 original under miscellaneous 


Reconstruct Passed Test Inputs
1 0
1 1000
2 1
2 100
2 10000
3 1000
on all four test cases
2 1000
on big youtube file (test5.txt)
(only bug is there is a floating point error somewhere)

Testing fast
Using diff instead
Writing script that tests the parameters of multithreading constant or rho = 0
Passes all four test inputs
binary outputs is on the testing file
