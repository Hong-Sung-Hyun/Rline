# Rline
R wrapper package around the LINE algorithm for network embedding. Original Line algorithm can be found at https://github.com/tangjianpku/LINE. This package wraps the four original LINE algorithms reconstruct, line, concatenate, and normalize in R. The R functions calls internal Rcpp functions which calls the original C++ Line functions. 

### Prerequisites
Needs to be run on a LINUX machine with GSL package installed for C++. GSL package can be downloaded at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

### Network Input
The input of a network consists of the edges in the network. Each line of the input file represents a DIRECTED edge in the network, which is specified as the format "source target weight" (can be either separated by blank or tab). For each undirected edge, users must use TWO DIRECTED edges to represent it. Here is an input example of a word co-occurrence network:

```
good the 3
the good 3
good bad 1
bad good 1
bad of 4
of bad 4
```

### Running Rline
You can run the package with devtools::load_all() and then call the four functions. The algorithm's work flow is reconstruct -> line -> concatenate -> normalize. Please reference the documentation and examples for more information on the specific parameters, inputs, and outputs of each function.


### Rline Results
After calling Rline, you should get an embedded graph representation of your original input. This embedded graph should be encoded in a numeric matrix format. The row names represent the vertices of the embedded graph. Each row of the numeric matrix represents the weights of that row vertice.

### Testing 
Reference the train.sh file to see all the compilation and examples on how to run the functions.
Under test_scripts there are test scripts you can run to verify the validity of the algorithm's respective functions.


### Differences and Further Notes
There are some minute differences between Rline and LINE. First, unlike the original LINE, Rline wraps the original LINE files compiled without the options -march=native and -Ofast. This is too reduce the randomness of the LINE algorithm outputs and increase the compatability of the original LINE algorithm. This comes at a cost of slightly slower computation times for all functions. Next, there are some precision differences between the LINE and Rline normalize function due to floating point arithmetic differences between C++ and R (roughly 1e-6 in magnitude). Finally, the test scripts in the normalize and concatenate functions read from regular .txt files (with strings and doubles as input and output) as opposed to the original LINE algorithm which inputs and outputs binary formatted data. Please call all functions with binary option set to 0 as Rline cannot output binary formatted data.
