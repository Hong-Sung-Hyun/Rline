Completed Work
-finish up writing and calling from system (done)
-read the code and add ways to change the parameter (done)
-test with five basic test_cases (done)
-read RCpp (use RCpp because saves work) with this tutorial http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html 
-write simple RCpp function
-write wrapper R function that calls RCpp function with data matrix passed in (and parameters)
-understand LINE better to figure out which parameters to take in
-write wrapper C function 
-read reconstruct
-write function in R that takes in string and two inputs
-wrote the function that takes in input and output/changed c++ code to accept vectors and not read/write into output files
-wrote function that takes in Rcpp as main line command
-understand how to write package in stat 133

Todo:
1) write Rcpp package day 2 10
2) write linker day 3 11
3) write string function that takes in command line arguments as string 12:30 - 2:30
Week 5
4) write the same for all 3 other functions
Week 6
5) test and package!

-figure out input parameters/pass in as string
-figure out test cases and finalize

Future work
-write test generator or figure out how to generate words as vertexes
-write all the tests
-write testing framework using diff in either python or java
-test all the cases
-debug?

-learn how to write it as a package
-write it as a package
